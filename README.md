# OOP Library Project
An information storage system realizing a digital library database.

Each book has an Author, Title, Genre, Short description, Year of publishing, as a unique identifier.

The system supports two types of users - Administrators and Clients.
Clients can query which books are avaliable in the library, while administrators can also add/remove books and other users. Guests can do neither.
